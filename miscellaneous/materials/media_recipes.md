# Media Recipes

The composition of the base media and supplements 
used in this work are given below. 


## N-C- Buffer Base
Below is the growth-supporting concentrations of the components of the basic N-C-
buffer system. These are the final concentrations per batch of growth medium. A 
4X stock is typically prepared and stored at room temperature and diluted as needed. 

| **Chemical Species** | **Concentration** | **Amount per 500 mL**|
|:--:|:--:|
|K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> | 5.7 mM | 
|K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> | 77.5 mM |
|KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> | 34.5 mM |
|MgSO<sub>4</sub> | N-C- Buffer Base | 400 µM |
|NaCl | N-C- Buffer Base | 43.1 mM |
|Organic Acid or Sugar | Carbon Source | Variable |
|NH<sub>4</sub>Cl | Nitrogen Source | 10 mM |

## Micronutrients
Below is the final growth supporting concentrations of trace elements in all 
growth conditions. This is typically stored as a 1000X stock and kept at -20 C
and diluted as necessary. 

|**Chemical Species** | **Concentration µM** |
| :--: | :--: |
| (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub> • 4H<sub>2</sub> | 3 |
|H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> | 400 | 
|CoCl<sub>2</sub> • 6H<sub>2</sub>O  | 30 |
|CuSO<sub>4</sub> | 10 |
|MnCl<sub>2</sub> | 80 | 
|ZnSO<sub>4</sub> • 7H<sub>2</sub>O | 10 |
